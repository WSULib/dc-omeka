Search (module for Omeka S)
===========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/biblibre/omeka-s-module-Search.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/biblibre/omeka-s-module-Search)

[Search] is a module for [Omeka S] that adds search capabilities to the public
interface of Omeka S, in particular filters and facets. Furthermore, it provides
a common interface for other modules to extend it (forms, indexers, queriers).

It can be extended in two ways:

- Forms that will build the search form and construct the query
- Adapters that will do the real work (indexing and querying)

A basic form is provided, with one single main search field without filters,
enough in most of the cases for the end uers, especially because the results
allow facets. An advanced example of a full form is [Psl Search Form], that
displays filters for item sets, selected properties, range of dates and map
locations. Note: some features of this advanced form are not managed by the
internal adapter currently, in particular the queries on a range of dates.

An internal adapter is provided too. It uses the internal Api of Omeka to search
resources. There is no indexer currently, and the search engine is the sql one,
so it is limited strictly to the request like the standard Omeka S search engine
(no wildcards, no management of singular/plural, etc.). Nevertheless, it
provides the facets to improve the results. A module is available for [Solr],
one of the most used search engine.

The Psl search form and the Solr modules were initially built by [BibLibre] and
are used by the [digital library of PSL], a French university.


Installation
------------

Uncompress the zip inside the folder `modules` and rename it `Search`.

See general end user documentation for [Installing a module].

### Requirements

- Module [jQueryUI] for admin interface, to manage the fields used by the form.

### Optional dependency

- Module [Reference] to display facets in the results with the internal adapter.
  It is not needed for external search engines.


Quick start
-----------

The main admin menu `Search` allows to manage the search indexes and the search
pages: an instance of Omeka can contain multiple indexes, for example to hide
some fields in the public front-end, and multiple pages, for example a single
field search and an advanced search with filters, or different parameters for
different sites or different resource types (items or item sets).

An index and a page for the internal adapter are automatically prepared during
install. This search engine can be enabled in main settings and site settings.
It can be removed too.

To create a new search engine, follow these steps.

1. Create an index
    1. Add a new index with name `Internal` or whatever you want, using the
       `Internal` adapter. The index can be set for items and/or item sets.
    2. The internal adapter doesn’t create any index, so you don’t need to
       launch the indexation by clicking on the "reindex" button (two arrows
       forming a circle).
2. Create a page
    1. Add a page named `Internal search` or whatever you want, a path to access
       it, for example `search` or `find`, the index that was created in the
       previous step (`Internal` here), and a form adapter (`Basic`) that will
       do the mapping between the form and the index. Forms added by modules can
       manage an advanced input field and/or filters.
    2. In the page configuration, you can enable/disable facet and sort fields
       by drag-drop. The order of the fields will be the one that will be used
       for display. Note that some indexers may have fields that seem
       duplicated, but they aren’t: some of them allow to prepare search indexes
       and some other facets or sort indexes. Some of them may be used for all
       uses. This is not the case for the internal indexer, since there is no
       index.
       For example, you can use `dcterms:type`, `dcterms:subject`,
       `dcterms:creator`, `dcterms:date`, `dcterms:spatial`, `dcterms:language`
       and `dcterms:rights` as facets, and `dcterms:title`, `dcterms:date`, and
       `dcterms:creator` as sort fields.
       **Important**: with the internal adapter, the facets work only if the
       module [Reference] is enabled.
    3. Edit the name of the label that will be used for facets and sort fields
       in the same page. The string will be automatically translated if it
       exists in Omeka.
3. In admin and site settings
    1. To access to the search form, enable it in the main settings (for the
       admin board) and in the site settings (for the front-end sites). So the
       search engine will be available in the specified path: `https://example.com/s/my-site/search`
       or `https://example.com/admin/search` in this example.
    2. Optionally, add a custom navigation link to the search page in the
       navigation settings of the site.

The search form should appear. Type some text then submit the form to display
the results as grid or as list. The page can be themed.

**IMPORTANT**

The Search module  does not replace the default search page neither the default
search engine. So the theme should be updated.


Search api
----------

The search engine can be used not only for the classical search page, but for
any other views too where you the search of items need to be done quickly, for
example the block layouts with a big database (more than 10000 to 100000 items,
according to your server and your collections).

To use this feature, a page should be created with the form `Api`. This form is
not a true form, but it allows to map the Omeka metadata and properties with the
fields indexed by the search engine. It allows to define a max number of results
too, that is used when no paginator is enable. The argument `limit` cannot go
further.

When ready, the api search is available via multiple means.
- Add `index=1` as query in the block layouts that use it, like [Browse preview].
- Do a standard search with `$this->api()->search()` with the value `'index' => true`
  appended to the argument `$data` or `$options` (recommended when possible to
  avoid to mix the query and the parameters).
- Do a standard search in the theme with the view helpers `$this->apiSearch()`,
  and `$this->apiSearchOne()`, that have the same arguments than `$this->api()->search()`
  and `$this->api()->searchOne()`. The result is an Omeka Response.
- Use the controller plugins `$this->apiSearch()` and `$this->apiSearchOne()`.
- The main api manager understand these arguments too.
- If the api page form is made available on a site, it will be a quick access to
  the results at `/s/mysite/api_search_page`.

Note that some features may be not available in the external search engine. In
particular, some events are not triggered.


Indexation
----------

The indexation of items and item sets is automatic and all new metadata can be
searched in the admin board. Note that there may be a cache somewhere, and they
may be not searchable in the public sites.

So when the item pool of a site or the item sets attached to it are modified, a
manual reindexation should be done in the Search board. This job can be done via
a cron too (see your system cron).

Furthermore, there may be an indexation delay between the moment when a resource
is saved and the moment when it is fully available in the search engine (it may
be some minutes with Solr, according to your configuration).


TODO
----

- Normalize the url query with a true standard (or the Omeka S one, or at the
  choice of the admin, or the developer of the forms and queriers).
- Make the search arguments groupable to allow smart facets: always display all
  facets from the original queries, with "or" between facets of the same group,
  and "and" between groups. Require that the core api allows groups.
- Use the standard view with tabs and property selector for the page creation,
  in order not to limit it to Dublin Core terms. It will avoid the dependency to
  the module [jQueryUI] too. The tabs may be "Filters", "Facets", and "Sort".
- Create an internal index (see Omeka Classic) and move all related code into
  another module.
- Allow to remove an index without removing pages.
- Allow to import/export a mapping via json, for example the default one.
- Add an option to use the search api by default (and an option `'index' => false`).
- Set one api page by site and a quick set in the pages settings.
- Option to forbid default search and advanced search in public front-end.
- Update index when item pool of a site change.
- Genericize and move the value extractor from module Solr to module Search.
- Improve the check of presence of an item in sites for real time indexation.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
